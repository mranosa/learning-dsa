## Key Concepts

### All Patterns Combined
- **Arrays:** Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum
- **Hash Maps:** Fast lookups, frequency counting
- **Trees:** DFS, BFS, serialization
- **Graphs:** Topological sort, cycle detection
- **DP:** 1D, 2D, interval DP, memoization
- **Advanced:** Parsing, trie-based solutions

### Mixed Strategies
- **Pattern recognition:** Identify which technique applies
- **Combination:** Use multiple patterns together
- **Trade-offs:** Balance time vs space complexity
- **Edge cases:** Handle complex boundary conditions

### When to Use What
- Graph dependencies → Topological sort
- Tree encoding → Serialization techniques
- Grid paths → DFS + memoization
- Intervals → DP with binary search
- Expressions → Recursive descent parsing

## Tips

1. Review pattern cheat sheets from all sessions
2. Focus on pattern recognition first
3. Start with brute force, then optimize
4. Draw examples for complex problems
5. Test systematically with edge cases
6. Learn from multiple solution approaches
7. Practice explaining your thought process

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Jumping to code without planning
- ❌ Missing which pattern to apply
- ❌ Overcomplicating simple solutions
- ❌ Ignoring time/space constraints
- ❌ Not testing edge cases
- ❌ Poor time management across problems

## What's Next

After completion:
1. Review all weak areas
2. Retake difficult problems
3. Update PROGRESS-TRACKER.md
4. Schedule mock interviews
5. You're ready for real interviews!

**This is the final session - congratulations on completing the bootcamp!**

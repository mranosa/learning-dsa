## Key Concepts

### Advanced Patterns
- **Topological Sort** - Ordering with dependencies
- **Serialization** - Converting structures to strings
- **Memoized DFS** - Combining recursion with caching
- **Interval DP** - Problems on ranges
- **Expression Parsing** - Evaluating complex expressions

### Complex Time Complexities
- **O(V + E)** - Graph traversal
- **O(n * m * k)** - Multi-dimensional DP
- **O(n²ᵏ)** - K-group operations
- **O(2ⁿ)** - Exponential backtracking
- **O(n³)** - Interval DP

### Critical Techniques
- Graph cycle detection
- Binary indexed trees
- State compression
- Rolling arrays for DP
- Expression tree building

- [ ] Identify optimal approach within 10 min
- [ ] Implement clean, bug-free code
- [ ] Explain trade-offs clearly
- [ ] Handle all edge cases

---

## Resources

**Videos:** See LESSON.md for links

**References:**
- Algorithm Design Manual
- Competitive Programming 3
- PROGRESS-TRACKER.md for problem history

**Practice:**
- All problems in PROBLEMS.md
- Multiple solutions in SOLUTIONS.md
- Progressive hints in HINTS.md

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Read carefully** - Hard problems have subtle requirements
2. **Draw examples** - Visualize complex scenarios
3. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
4. **Test thoroughly** - Edge cases are critical
5. **Time management** - Know when to move on
6. **Stay calm** - These are meant to be challenging
7. **Learn from solutions** - Multiple approaches exist

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Watch out for:**
- ❌ Missing edge cases in complex logic
- ❌ Integer overflow in calculations
- ❌ Inefficient string operations
- ❌ Memory limit exceeded in DP
- ❌ Infinite loops in graph traversal
- ❌ Off-by-one errors in intervals

---

## What's Next

After completing this session:
1. Review all weak areas identified
2. Revisit problems you struggled with
3. Update your PROGRESS-TRACKER.md
4. Schedule mock interviews
5. You're ready for real interviews!

This is the final session - congratulations on completing the bootcamp!

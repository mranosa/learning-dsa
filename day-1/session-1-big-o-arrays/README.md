## Key Concepts

### Big O Notation
- **O(1)** - Constant time (array access)
- **O(log n)** - Logarithmic (binary search)
- **O(n)** - Linear (single loop)
- **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic (efficient sorting)
- **O(n²)** - Quadratic (nested loops)
- **O(2ⁿ)** - Exponential (brute force recursion)

### Array Operations
- **Access by index:** O(1)
- **Search:** O(n)
- **Insert/Delete at end:** O(1)
- **Insert/Delete at start:** O(n)
- **Sort:** O(n log n)

### Common Patterns
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window (preview for next session)
- Prefix Sum
- Kadane's Algorithm

## Success Criteria

You're ready to move on when you can:
- [ ] Explain Big O notation confidently
- [ ] Estimate complexity of simple algorithms
- [ ] Solve Easy array problems in <15 min
- [ ] Identify array patterns quickly
- [ ] Use TypeScript array methods correctly

---

## Resources

**Video:** See LESSON.md for link

**Readings:**
- Big O Cheat Sheet: https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/
- Array methods: TYPESCRIPT-LEETCODE.md

**Practice:**
- All problems in PROBLEMS.md
- Solutions in SOLUTIONS.md
- Hints in HINTS.md

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip the video** - Foundation is critical
2. **Actually do the concept check** - It reveals gaps
3. **Start with Easy problems** - Build confidence first
4. **Use UMPIRE method** - Every single problem
5. **Think aloud** - Practice interview communication
6. **Time yourself** - Simulate real pressure
7. **Review solutions** - Even if you got it right

---

## Common Mistakes

**Avoid these:**
- ❌ Jumping straight to coding without understanding
- ❌ Not considering edge cases (empty array, single element)
- ❌ Forgetting to analyze complexity
- ❌ Using array.sort() without comparator in TypeScript
- ❌ Mutating input array without asking if it's allowed

## What's Next

After completing this session:
1. Take a 10-minute break
2. Review your performance scores
3. Note your action items
4. Move to Session 2: Hash Maps

Session 2 builds on arrays by introducing O(1) lookups with hash maps.

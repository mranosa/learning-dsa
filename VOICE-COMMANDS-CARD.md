## 💬 While Coding (NO F12 - Just Speak!)

**Interactive mode listens continuously:**

- "I'm creating a map to store..." → I respond!
- "The time complexity is..." → I verify!
- "What if array is empty?" → I answer!
- "Let me loop through..." → I acknowledge!

**I'll respond to:**
- ✅ Questions
- ✅ Thinking aloud
- ✅ Explanations
- ✅ Uncertainty

**I'll check in if you're silent > 30s**

---

## 🎯 "OK Submit" Feature

**With "ok submit":** Auto-presses Enter
```
F12: "Give me the problem, ok submit"
→ Types "Give me the problem" + presses Enter
```

**Without "ok submit":** You press Enter manually
```
F12: "I think I'll use a hash map"
→ Types "I think I'll use a hash map" (waits for Enter)
```

**Use "ok submit" for:**
- ✅ Commands you're sure about
- ✅ Quick responses
- ✅ Hands-free flow

**Skip "ok submit" when:**
- ⚠️ Want to review transcription first
- ⚠️ Might need to edit
- ⚠️ Unsure of what was transcribed

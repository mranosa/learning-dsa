# Session 0 Test Problems

3 easy problems to test the complete voice interview system.

**Focus:** System verification, not difficulty
**Time:** 5-10 min each (total 20-30 min)

## Problem 1: Two Sum (System Test)

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Time Target:** 5-10 min
**Pattern:** Hash Map
**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

**What We're Testing:**
- ✅ F12 voice input
- ✅ "ok submit" feature
- ✅ I respond with voice
- ✅ Problem presentation

### Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

**Test This:**
1. F12: "Give me problem 1, ok submit"
2. Open LeetCode: Two Sum
3. Code in LeetCode editor
4. Use phrase: "I'm creating a map to store..."
5. Use term: "complement"
6. Click "Run" in LeetCode
7. F12: "Tests pass, evaluate me, ok submit"

## Problem 2: Valid Palindrome (Interactive Mode Test)

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Time Target:** 5-10 min
**Pattern:** Two Pointers
**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/

**What We're Testing:**
- ✅ Interactive mode (continuous listening)
- ✅ Thinking aloud responses
- ✅ Vocabulary usage
- ✅ Real-time conversation

### Problem

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, `false` otherwise.

A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. Only consider alphanumeric characters and ignore cases.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```

**Test This:**
1. F12: "Give me problem 2, ok submit"
2. **Think aloud while coding:**
   - "I'll use two pointers..."
   - "Initialize left at start, right at end..."
   - "The time complexity is O of n..."
3. **I should respond** to your thinking!
4. Use terms: pointer, iterate, adjacent
5. Run LeetCode tests
6. F12: "Evaluate me, ok submit"

## Problem 3: Contains Duplicate (Complete Flow Test)

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Time Target:** 5 min
**Pattern:** Hash Set
**LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/

**What We're Testing:**
- ✅ Complete problem flow
- ✅ Quick solve with good communication
- ✅ Session end with narrative

### Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Test This:**
1. F12: "Give me problem 3, ok submit"
2. Quick solve (use hash set)
3. Think aloud: "I'm using a set to track..."
4. Use terms: iterate, optimal
5. Test in LeetCode
6. F12: "Evaluate me, ok submit"
7. **F12: "End session, ok submit"**
8. **Verify git commit** has narrative!

## Key Concepts

### Two Pointers Patterns
- **Opposite Direction** - Start ends, move inward
- **Same Direction (Fast/Slow)** - Different speeds
- **Multiple Pointers** - 3+ pointers

### Common Use Cases
- Palindrome checking: O(n)
- Pair/triplet finding: O(n) or O(n²)
- In-place operations: O(1) space
- Array partitioning

### Complexity Improvements
- O(n²) → O(n) (pair finding)
- O(n³) → O(n²) (triplet finding)
- Leverage sorted arrays

---

## Prerequisites

**Must know:**
- Array syntax in TypeScript
- For loops, iteration
- Time complexity basics

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Identify when to use two pointers
- [ ] Choose between opposite/same direction
- [ ] Solve Easy problems <15 min
- [ ] Explain complexity improvements
- [ ] Handle pointer movement correctly

**Video:** LESSON.md
**Practice:** PROBLEMS.md
**Solutions:** SOLUTIONS.md
**Hints:** HINTS.md

## Tips

1. Draw pointers moving through examples
2. Check if sorting helps
3. Watch pointer boundaries
4. Practice movement logic
5. Consider edge cases (empty, single element)
6. Time yourself
7. Review solutions even if correct

---

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Moving both pointers without logic
- ❌ Forgetting pointer crossing check
- ❌ Not sorting when needed
- ❌ Off-by-one errors
- ❌ Using two pointers when hash map is better

## What's Next

After completion:
1. 10-minute break
2. Review scores
3. Note action items
4. Session 5: Binary Search

Session 5 uses sorted arrays for O(log n) searches.

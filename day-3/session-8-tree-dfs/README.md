## Key Concepts

### DFS Traversals
- **Preorder:** Root → Left → Right (top-down)
- **Inorder:** Left → Root → Right (sorted BST)
- **Postorder:** Left → Right → Root (bottom-up)

### Tree Properties
- **Height:** Longest path to leaf
- **Diameter:** Longest path between any nodes
- **Balance:** Height difference ≤ 1

### Patterns
- Recursive helper functions
- Top-down vs bottom-up
- Path tracking with backtracking
- Global variables for optimization

---

## Prerequisites

**Must know:**
- Recursion fundamentals
- TypeScript class syntax
- Basic tree terminology

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implement 3 traversals from memory
- [ ] Calculate tree height recursively
- [ ] Solve Easy problems <15 min
- [ ] Identify top-down vs bottom-up
- [ ] Handle null, single node, skewed trees

**Video:** LESSON.md
**Practice:** PROBLEMS.md
**Solutions:** SOLUTIONS.md
**Hints:** HINTS.md

## Tips

1. Draw trees on paper - visualize first
2. Start with null check - always first
3. Trust the recursion - don't overthink
4. Use helper functions - keep code clean
5. Think aloud - practice communication
6. Test edge cases - null, single, skewed
7. Review solutions even if correct

---

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Forgetting null checks
- ❌ Off-by-one in height calculations
- ❌ Confusing height vs depth
- ❌ Not considering negative values
- ❌ Modifying tree without permission

## What's Next

After completion:
1. 10-minute break
2. Review scores
3. Note action items
4. Session 9: Tree BFS
